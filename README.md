# Object Segmentation

## Deploy instructions

* Install `docker` and `docker-compose` on a target machine
* Open a TCP:80 port. If you want to use another port, consult the docs: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/
* Clone this repository to the target machine
* From the repo folder run `docker-compose up segmentator`. It should build a Docker image and launch the app
